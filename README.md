# credit-card-checker

Javascript practice creating a function that validates if a credit card number is valid or invalid based on certain conditions. 

The code includes functions for validating credit card numbers and identifying the company that issued an invalid card. The validateCred() function uses the Luhn algorithm to determine if a credit card number is valid or not. The idInvalidCardCompanies() function takes an array of invalid card numbers and returns an array of the companies that issued those cards.

The page itself is simply styled with Tailwind CSS.
